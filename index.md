### About<a name="about"></a>

![grand teton](http://alancleary.github.io/images/grand-teton-2016.jpg)

I am a Ph.D student in the Computer Science program at Montana State University (MSU), Bozeman.
My advisor is [Dr. Brendan Mumey](https://brendanmumey.wordpress.com/about/).
In my spare time I enjoy downhill skiing, rock climbing, and mountain biking.
I also play guitar when I can.

I currently work as a Research Scientist for the National Center for Genome Resources and as a Research Assistant for the Applied Algorithms Laboratory at MSU.

Ph.D, Computer Science, Montana State University, 2013-present  
B.A., Computer Information Science, Western State College of Colorado, 2012  
B.A., Mathematics, Western State College of Colorado, 2012

### Research<a name="research"></a>

Generally, I am interested in algorithms for hard, practical problems, though my main focus is on Computational Biology.
Recently I have been working on methods for visually exploring and mining data from genomic databases and developing algorithms for pan/population genomcics.
