Hello.
My name is Alan.
I am a Computational Research Scientist at the National Center for Genome Resources.
In my spare time I enjoy downhill skiing, rock climbing, and mountain biking.
I also play guitar when I can.

### Research<a name="research"></a>

Generally, I am interested in algorithms for hard, practical problems, though my main focus is on Computational Biology.
Recently I have been working on methods for visually exploring and mining data from genomic databases and developing algorithms for pan/population genomcics, with an eye towards parallelism and high performance computing.
